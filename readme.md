## Optimal Prompt Design for Zero-Shot Apple Leaf Disease Identification

This repository contains the code and resources for the paper "Optimal Prompt Design for Zero-Shot Apple Leaf Disease Identification". The paper proposes a novel approach to zero-shot apple leaf disease identification by optimizing the prompt design for the model. The code includes the implementation of the proposed method, along with the necessary data and models.
